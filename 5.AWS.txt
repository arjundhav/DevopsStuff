# AWS: Its public cloud

# Region: Group of Data centers => us-east-1

# Availablity Zone: Data Center => us-east-1b
                  (If theirs alpha at end its zone) 


Region is selected based on client location.It is selected based on below factors :

# Latency - A major factor to consider for user experience is latency(measures 
            delay in packet's arrival between client-server in mmsec).
 
# Cost- AWS services are priced differently from one Region to another.

# Services&features- New services&features are deployed to Regions gradually.

***************************** AWS Backup ********************************************

There are 2 types of backups:
  i) Ondemand - Manual Backup
 ii) BackupPlan - Auto Backup

# Backup of EC2:

  Type:
      1.On Demand - manual backup
  *** 2.Backup Plan - Taking Backup weekly on every saturday generally at 10am. 
                      2 week retention period
 
 
  1. Backup Vault - It is container that stores and organizes your backups.
 
  2. Retention Period - tells for how much time backup needs to be stored.

# Backup vaults: 

 - Backup vaults are storage locations for backups. 
 -You can create multiple backup vaults in different regions & assign backup rules to them.

# Backup policies: 

   Backup policies define backup plan schedule,which specifies when backup jobs should run. 
   You can create multiple backup policies & apply them to different resources.

# Steps to Create a Backup Vault:

  i)AWS Console,Select AWS Backup service from list of available services.
 ii)Click on “Create Backup Vault” to start the creation process.
iii)Provide a unique name for the backup vault.
 iv)Choose the AWS region where you want to create the backup vault.
  v)Choose an encryption setting for backup vault. 
    We can use default AWS Key Management Service(KMS) master key/create custom KMS key.
 vi)Review backup vault details and click “Create backup vault” to complete the process.

# To delete vault we need to delete first recovery point.

******************************* Elastic IP address **********************************

  - It is public static IPv4 address designed for dynamic cloud computing.   

  - It is allocated to your AWS account & is yours until you release it.

  - If your instance does not have a public IPv4 address, you can associate an 
    Elastic IP address with your instance to enable communication with the internet.      
    Ex: this allows you to connect to your instance from your local computer.

  - Elastic IP is assigned after instance is stopped,thus charges only after EC2 is stopped

# USECASE: As we know whenever we restart EC2 instance it Public IP changed everytime.
           If there is any imp EC2 machine and we dont wanna lose its public IP in such 
           case we use Elastic IP

# Steps to associate Elastic IP ( EIP ) address:
 
 Goto, Network & Security -> Elastic IPs ->Allocate addr
   
   i)Select the Elastic IP: Select new created Elastic IP addr by clicking on checkbox 
  ii)Associate Elastic IP with Instance:For EIP Actions-> choose "Associate IP addr.
 iii)Choose the Instance: Select instance that you want to associate with Elastic IP.
  iv)Confirm and Verify Association of Elastic IP

Now, your instance should have static public IP address & Elastic IP associated with it, which will remain same even if you stop and start instance. This can be useful when you need consistent public IP address for services like hosting a website or setting up remote access.

*************************** A W S Storage *******************************************

1.S3(Simple Storage Serice)is ObjectBasedStorage 
  - For multiple users
  - Google Drive 
  - It’s more of a write once, read many times use case.

2.EFS(Elastic File sharing/service/system) 
   - It is like Linux NFS(Network File Sharing)
   - for multiple linux VM's

3.Glacier - low-cost cloud storage service for data
          - secure and long term 
          - with longer retrieval times offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS).
    -Eg: Legal documents or long-term backups that don't require immediate access.

4.Snowball -
    - Its hardware Easily migrate terabytes of data to cloud without limits in 
      storage capacity or compute power.

    - Use case: Move databases,backups, archives, healthcare records, analytics 
                datasets, IoT sensor data and media content to the cloud 

    - Especially when network conditions are limited.

5.EBS(Elastic Block Storage) - Its only for one VM
 - It provides block level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances.
 - Data is persistent.
 - Auto recovery
 - Block storage systems support random read/write operations

6.Instance Storage => 
     - Its temporary block storage service provided by AWS.
     - Data is non-persistent 

===========================================================================================


===================================================================================
ENV - its space where we work

 1.Development Env(Dev) => This is where developers work on writing & testing code. 
    
    - It's typically local setup on their own computers or shared development server. 
    - It allows developers to experiment, debug & collaborate without affecting main 
      app or system.

 2.User Acceptance Testing(UAT) => 
    
    - Its phase where software is tested by end-users to ensure it meets business 
      requirements & functions correctly. 
    - All issues found during UAT are addressed before software is released to   
      production.
 
 3.Production Environment(Prod) =>
    - It is where final version of the software or application is deployed & made 
      available to users.  


====================================================================================

## CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing): -supernetting

 - This is an alternative to older subnetting
 - CIDR is a method for allocating IP addresses for allocating IP or data routing 
   efficiency.

#Benefits:
 - Reduce IP address wastage
 - Create supernets flexibly
 - Transmits data quickly-allows routers to organize IP addrs into multiple subnets

 for ex:  192.168.10.0/25

Decimal:      255         255          255          0
Binary:    11111111     11111111     11111111    00000000
Octet:         8            8            8           1
 
-  How to find no of network?       - subnet
   => 2^n  (n is total no.of.bits borrowed from host)
      2^1 = 2

- How to find no.of.Ip address on each network?
  => 2^n  (n is total no.of.host bits)
     2^7 = 128  (n= 8-1 =7) 

- In every network,1st IP is reserved for network ID and last IP addr is reserved for 
  broadcast ID

- How to find no.of.host in each network?
 => 2^n - 2 = 128 - 2 = 126

  192.168.10.0 - Network ID
  .
  .
  192.168.10.127 - Broadcast ID

# AWS reserve 5 IPs  thus ideally CIDR uses 16-28 as range

********************** Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) *******************************

 - VPC is a private space hosted within the cloud. 
 - It allows private section of internet just like having own network within large 
   network
 - Every aws user when creates an account, AWS will create a default VPC for user.
   But this VPC is just to start AWS.Further we need to create VPCs for our projects 
   manually
 - It allows your organization to provision workloads in an isolated & secure env. 
 - It uses CIDR IP addrs when it transfers data packets between connected devices.

 Components of VPC: 

 - Internet gateway: It decides who can connect public subnet at Instance level.  
                     Like Web Server EC2.

 - NAT gateway: It decide who can connect private subnet.Like DB Server EC2

 - Implied Router & Route tables: 
===================================================================================

Hands On needed for:

 - IAM users, policies, and roles
 - EC2 instances
 - Security Groups(SG) => virtual firewall for your EC2 to control incoming & 
                          outgoing traffic.

 - Elastic Block Storage (EBS)

 - Elastic Load Balancer(ELB)=> distributes incoming app traffic & scales resources 
                                to meet traffic demands.

 - Relational Database Service (RDS)

 - Simple Storage Service (S3) — Standard storage class

 - DynamoDB

 - AWS Lambda

 - AWS CloudWatch

 - Virtual Private Cloud(VPC)

 - AWS CloudFormation - helps to automate process of creating,configuring & managing   
                        AWS resources.

 - AWS Elastic Beanstalk

# Subnetting: It is a logical subdivision of an IP network.
   Class A - 10.10.0.1 - 255.0.0.0 
   Class B - 172.168.100.5 - 255.255.0.0
   Class C - 192.168.100.5 - 255.255.255.0

     where 255 is network id & 0 is host ID

- Unicast:   Data is sent to a single recipient	
  Multicast: Data is sent to a group of recipients   
  Broadcast: Data is sent to all recipients in a network
