**************************** S3 Bucket *******************************************

1. Object based storage.Objects are entities stoed in AWS S3.
2. 3 copies of data in same egion
3. You cant create bucket inside bucket
4. The max capacity of bucket is unlimited i.e single obj capacity 5TB.
5. Its global service.

# Versioning: 

  - Versioning in S3 is means keeping multiple variants of an object in same bucket. 
  - S3 Versioning feature helps to preserve,retrieve & restore every version of every 
    object stored in buckets
  - If filename is same then only it will create versioning.
  - Versioning-enabled buckets can help to recover objects from accidental deletion or 
    overwrite. 
  - We can enable or suspend versioning can't disable.

# AWS ClI cmnd: 
               aws s3 ls => lists bucket
               aws s3 mb s3://Arjun => create bucket Arjun
               aws s3 rb s3://Arjun => delete bucket Arjun
               aws s3 sync . s3://bucketName
               aws s3 rm s3://bucketname --recursive => Delete bucket objects

# AWS DataSync is a secure, online service that automates and accelerates moving data between on premises and AWS Storage services.

     >> aws s3 sync . s3://<bucket-name>


# Storage Classes of S3:

1. Amazon S3 Standard(By Default it is selected)

 - S3 offers high durability,availability & performance object storage for frequently    
   access date.
 - Durability is 99.9999999999%
 - Availability - 99.99%
 - Support for SSL.(secure socket layer)
 - Its storage cost for object is high,but there is very less charge for accessing object.
 - Largest object that can be uploadedd in a single PUT is TB.

2. Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access

 - It is for data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed.
 - Storage cost is much cheaper than S3-std i.e half the price,but you are charged more    
   heavily for accessing your obbjects.
 - Durability is 99.9999999999%
 - Availability - 99.9%
 - Data that  is deleted from S3-IA within 30 days will be charged for a full 30 days.

3. Amazon S3 Intelligent Tiering

- The S3 Intelligent Tiering storage class is desined to optimize cost by  automatically 
  moving data to the most cost effective access tier.
- It works by storing objects in two access tiers.
- If an object in frequent access tier is accessed, it is automatically moved back  to        
  frequent access tier.
- There is no retrieval fees when using S3-intelligent tiering storage class and no 
  additional tiering fee e=when object moved between access tiers.
- Same low latency and high performance of S3-std.
- Object less than 128kb can not move to IA.

4. Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)

- S3 one-zone is for data that is accessed less frequently, but required rapid access when    
  added.
- Data store inn single AZ.
- Ideal for those who  want lower cost option of IA-Data.
- It is good choice for storing secondary backup copies of on-prepmise data or easily re-
  creatable data.
- Durability is 99.9999999999%
- Availability - 99.5%

5. Amazon S3 Glaicer

- S3 Glacier is a secure, durable low cost storage  classs for data archiving.
- Designed to retain historical data for long periods.
- To keep cost storage low you can use S3 Glaicer.
- You can upload object directly to glacier or use lifecycle policies
- Durability is 99.9999999999%
- Support for SSL.
- You can retrieve 10GB of you S3 glacier data per/month for free with free tier account.
- Retrieval will take time of 2 to 4 hours

6. Amazon S3 Glaicer Deep Archive

- Cheapest storage.
- Designed to retain data for long periods. eg 10yrs
- All objects stored in S3-Glacier Deep archiev are replicated in 3 AZ.
- Ideal alternative to magnetic tape libraries.
- Retrieval time withinn 12 hours.
- Storage cost is upto 75% less than S3-Glacier.
- Durability is 99.9999999999%
- Availability - 99.9%

# To change storage class: Select Object ->click Action ->Edit Storage Class ->Select Class 

# In case we have thousands of object we have to set life cycle rules: 
           It is done to move a object from 1 storage class to another.
  
 Ex: S3 Std -> S3 Std-IA ->  
       0          30      

# Multi part uploading: I want to copy a large file to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket as multiple parts.
