A server is software/hardware device that accepts & responds to requests made over network.

1) What is Racks & Blade?
-> Rack server is used to stack & install several servers in a large closet.
   Blade is used to insert small servers in case stacked horizontally in rack.


2) What is OnPremise & OffPremise?
-> OnPremise is setting DataCenter on company's premise.
     - costly
     - maintenance is manual
     - More secured & max control over infrastructure & access.

  On-premises private cloud management is expensive and requires heavy initial investment and ongoing expenses.

  Offpremise(cloud) is not so costly,maintenance is automatic but requires some monthly fee.It gives less control over infrastructure & is accessible on any device.


3) What is Waterfall vs Agile ?
-> 
 Waterfall Model:
  - Its linear sequential lifecycle model.
  - Determines the end goal early i.e Provides fixed plan of project from start to finish
  - Documentation provides a clear scope to the project that helps to decide budgets & 
    timelines.
  - Used for small scale projects

  
  cons:
     - difficult to customize as it works on fixed method
     - There is no any collaboration with Client during Development.
     - Testers report issues and bugs later in the process.
   

 Agile Model: 
   
  Pros:
    - Their is continous collboration with clients
    - easy to customize i.e more flexible
    - encourages short-term deadlines
    - Transparency

   Cons: 
     - 

 Roles: 
   1)Product Owner-client- represents the needs of both the customer and the business. 
   2)Scrum Master - service company=> communicates & collaborates between leadership & team players to ensure a successful outcome.

 Sprint: The repetitive process that developers use to tackle a development project 
         it is of 14 days(2 weeks)


AGILE MEETINGS:

 Sprint Planning -1hr ->Team comes together to determine which stories will be part of current sprint.
                         - Front,Back,Devops,DBA,Product 0wner
 
 Daily standup - 15-30 min => 1.kal kya kia 2.aaj kya krne wale ho 3. prblms 
 
 Demo - 1hr => stackholders->showcases working software that team completed over course of sprint.
 
 Retropective - 1hr => 1. What well went
                       2. What didn't go well
                       3. Happiness Factor(give rating out of 5)


SpillOver - work of one sprint goes to next sprint

*********************** Networking ************************************************
4) What is OSI model?Its layers
=>  OSI(Open Systems Interconnection) is reference model for how apps communicate over network. 

   Trick to remember OSI - Please Do Not Throw Spicy Pizza Away.

   3 types of layers: Software Layer +> App,Presentation and Session Layer.
                      Hardware Layer => DataLinkLayer, Physical Layer
                      Heart of OSI  => Transport Layer


    Physical Layer - Bits- lowest layer - responsible for physical connection between devices - HUB
    
    Data Link Layer - Frame - to make sure data transfer is error-free from one node to another, over the physical layer. - Switch 

    Network Layer - Packet - transmission of data from one host to the other located in different networks - Router

    Transport Layer - Segment -responsible for End to End Delivery of complete message. - Firewall

    Session Layer - responsible for establishment of connection, maintenance of sessions,auth & ensures security - Gateway

    Presentation Layer(Translation layer) - Applicaton layer data is manipulated here & transmit over the network.

    Application Layer - layer also serves as window for application services to access network & for displaying received information to user. 


   - Pysical,DataLink and Network Layers are Hardware Layers

   - Transport Layer is heart of OSI => becoz it connects hardware & software layers.

   - Session,Presentation and Application Layer are Software Layers

   - Framing is a function of the data link layer. It provides a way for a sender to transmit a set of bits that are meaningful to the receiver.

   - Data in the transport layer is referred to as Segments. 


=====================================================================================

************************* Network Devices *****************************************

     Router - Router will connect Networks -connects LAN WAN - Filters & Send Packets - 2/4/8 ports

     Switch - Switch will helps connect devices -second data link layer & at times  network layer - 2 or more LAN devices - Filter before forwarding Data - Multi port between 4 & 48.

     HUB -sends data packets(frames) to all devices - 2 or more Ethernet Devices (LAN) - Unable to perform Filtering - 4/12 ports  - Layer 1


=====================================================================================

******************** Internet Protocol (IP) ***************************************

  A port is a virtual point where network connections start and end. 

  IP(Internet protocol) address : Its classes are A B C D E.
 
  IP contains 4 octets between 0 to 255.Its 32-bits.


  Class A - 1.0.0.0 to 126.255.255.255 => used for Governments
  Class B - 128 - 191 => Medium companies
  Class C - 192 - 223 => Small companies


  IP address range 127.0.0.0 â€“ 127.255.255.255 is reserved for loopback, i.e. Host's self-address, also known as localhost address

  Range of IP address: 1.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255

  IPv4:IPv4 Address Format is a 32-bit Address that comprises binary digits separated by a dot (.) => 2^32 => No encryption & Authentication.

  IPv6:IPv6 Address Format is 128-bit IP Address,which is written in group of 8 hexadecimal nums separated by colon (:) => 2^128 => Encryption & Auth is provided 

  IPv6 is better than IPv4 as IPv6 is more advanced.

  By typing IPConfig in cmd we will get Local Device IP address.

  MAC address is Physical address of device which is permenant.

  Hop Count - means Multiple routers

  Intranet - it gives private IP for local connection
  Internet - it gives public IP for Public connection

# Types of IP:

  i) Public IP addr: Is available publicly & assigned by our network provider to 
                    router,which is further divides to devices

  ii) Private IP: It is internal addr which is not routed to internet i.e no exchane 
                  of data between private IP and Internet. 
               - Intranet Connectivity
                
 iii) Static IP => We can manually assign this IP
           - Our Laptop IP address is Static IP coz theres no any DHCP for it.

  iv) Dynamic IP => DHCP will provide this IP

   v) Elastic IP => Public IP + Fixed(Reserved) -> DHCP provides it.
               - Used in case we dont want to change IP address for our Instances


# DHCP => Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol is protocol for automatically assigning 
          IP addresses & other configs to devices when they connect to  network.


TCP/IP allows computers on same network to identify & communicate with each other.

 FTP(21),SMTP(25),Telnet(23),ICMP,DNS(53)
 HTTP(80),HTTPS(443), RDP(Remote Desktop Protocol),SSH(Secure Shell)

Internet Assigned Numbers Authority has assigned india port numbers 

ping cmd is used to check connectivity and gives 

Microsoft Terminal Services Client (MSTSC) is the command line interface to run the Microsoft Remote Desktop (RDP) client
For windows: run/cmd ->mstc  => to connect anothr remote server (Enter ip addr)
For linux: ssh <username>@<IPAddress/server name> 

# OSI(theorotical,7Layers) vs TCP/IP(implementation of OSI,4layers)
# OSI model is General but mostly TCP/IP is used.


In Organizations VM is not launched using Public IP,its done using Private IP only.

*************************** Repomodel *********************************************** 
 
 Repo: a place or container in which something is stored in large quantities

 Package: Software

 JFrog Artifactory: It manages all packages,files,containers & components for use throughout your software supply chain.
 
 XRay: It scans packages,files & containers, it detects security vulnerabilities & licenses in your software components.
 
#Types:

 LocalRepo: EC2 instance Local
 RemoteRepo: Organization i.e jfrog. We use X-ray tool in jfrog.  
 CentralRepo: Its Internet.
 
 Jfrog:- Its repository manager that supports all available software package types, 
         enabling automated continous integration and delivery.

 It stores: Packages 
            Docker Images 
            Plugins 
            Artifacts

 If we want a any package we will first look into Remote Repo,if its not present here then we need to request from central repo.
