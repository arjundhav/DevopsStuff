Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services via the internet, without installing and maintaining them on-premises.

- It includes servers, storage, databases, networking etc. 

Cloud: It is on-demand availablity of computer sys resources on internet. Cloud provider allows clients to use computing resources without having to purchase or maintain hardware & software.  

It can be used using simple url.

types of clouds: private, public, hybrid clouds & multiclouds.


Public Cloud: It's service that owned by CSP & maintains compute resources that customers can access over the internet.
              It is open to all,to store and access information via the Internet using the pay-per-usage method.

             Ex: AWS,Microsoft Azure(Infra & PaaS),GCP(AI)

         
         - Low Cost
         - No Maintenance
         - Unlimited scalablity => can scale on its own
         - Better Reliablity => problem free



Private Cloud: It is cloud computing environment dedicated to a single organization and selected users instead of the general public.

       It is used by organizations to build  manage their own data centers internally or by third party.


         - Provides high level security & privacy to data to isolated network
         - High Performance
         - More Customization & full control over the cloud 



Hybrid Cloud: Hybrid cloud is a combination of public and private clouds. 
      
               Hybrid cloud = public cloud + private cloud.

           - It is used in finance, healthcare,banking and Universities.

          
          - Flexible 
          - Reliable => depends on CSP
          - More Secure

AD: Active directory maintain order that is managing users,computers, permissions and file servers.

- It is a database and set of services developed to help you with access,userse management, and permissions for your network resources.

- The company's data is stored as an object in the Active Directory, and it can be in the form of devices, files, users, applications, groups, or shared folders.

- LDAP(Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) for linux.

- We use RDP for Windows


AD Groups:

- Groups are very useful for giving or denying privileges to groups of users, rather than having to apply those privileges to each individual user. 

- So we provide access to users using AD group.
  In every company its practised

Types:
   **  Global Admin =>Read,Add,Modify & Delete Resources + user/access Mgmt **

        Global Admin =  AD-Cloud-Admin + AD-Cloud-Contributor

    - AD-Cloud-Admin => Add,Modify & Delete Resources
    - AD-Cloud-Readonly => Read Resources
    - AD-Cloud-Contributor => Read, Add, modify resources


**** Tell Interviewer we dont provide access to users.We are providing access to AD group ****
