VPC(Virtual Private Cloud): 

- Its virtual network or data center inside AWS for a one client
- Its logically isolated from other virtual network in the AWS cloud
- Max 5 VPC can be created in single region & 200 subnets in 1 VPC.
- We can allocate max 5 Elastic IP(IP's that are reserved)
- Once we create VPC, DHCP,NACL & security group will be automatically created.
- VPC is confined to AWS region & does not extend between regions.
  (Its Restricted to region)
- Once it is created we cant change CIDR block range


# Public subnet:

  - If a subnet traffic is connected to internet gateway it is known as Public Gateway. 

  - It is associated with custom route table(with igw id) that has route to an Internet gateway.It connects PC to Internet & to other AWS services. 
 

# Private subnet:

  - If subnet that doent have route to internet gateway  is known as Private group.

  - It is subnet that is associated with route table that doesn't have a route to an internet gateway.

## Router => Establish communication betwn 2 subnets
## Route table => holds path of communication i.e it provides 			   destination IP 


## Security Group acts as firewall that controls traffic allowed to & from resources in your VPC.

## NACL (Network Access Control List) which helps to provide a layer of security to the Amazon Web Services stack. NACL helps in providing a firewall thereby helping secure the VPCs and subnets. 

## Router is used to connect Private/Public subnets internally.

=====================================================================

## Component of VPC:

 	- Implied router or routing table
 	- Internet Gateway
 	- SECURITY Group
 	- Network ACL
 	- Virtual Private Gateway
 	- Peering Collection
 	- Elatic IP

##Flow: 
 	1.Create VPC
 	2.Subnets
 	3.Internet Gateway
 	4.Routing Table

#Types of VPC: - 
     
1)Default Table: 
   - Created in each AWS region when AWS account is created
   - It has default CIDR,security group,NACL & routing table setting 
   - AWS user has Internet Gateway(IG) by default.
     
2)Custom VPC:
   - Its a VPC & AWS account owner creates
   - AWS user creates custom VPC can decide CIDR
   - CUstom VPC have default security group,NACL& route tables
   - It doesnt have IG by default,we need to create if needed

 ***************** Components of VPC  ***********************

## Implied Router & Route Table:

-Its central routing func bcoz it establish connection betwn subnets. 
 - It connects VPC to internet gateway.
 - You can have upto 200 route tables.
 - You can have upto 50 route entries per route table. 
 - EACH SUBNET MUST BE ASSOCIATED WITH ONLY ONE ROUTE AT TIME.
 - We need to specify a subnet to route table association,else subnet will asociated with default VPC route table.


### Internet Gateway:
  - IG is virtual router that connects VPC to internet.
  - IG is VPC component that allows communication btwn VPC &internet.
  - Default VPC is already attached to IG
  - If we create new VPC we must attach IG in order to accss internet 
  - Its bi-directional as it manages incoming and outgoing data.
  - 0.0.0.0.00 is by defualt igw-id

# NAT gateway:  Network Address Translation Gateway
 
 - NAT gateway enables internet in private subnet,but prevents it 
   from intiating connection with those instances

 - Must need to assign Elastic IP to your NAT gateway

 - Deleting NAT gateway diassociates Elastic IP address,but does not 
   release address from your account 

 - NAT gateway is used to enable instances present in private subnet 
   to help connect to internet or AWS services.

 - Its uni-directional 

 - NAT Gateway is present in Public subnet but works for Private 
   subnet.
